  # Credit Contract Documentation

**Version: 2026-03-26**

The `Credit` contract implements on-chain credit lines for the Creditra protocol on Stellar Soroban. It manages the full lifecycle of a borrower's credit line — from opening to closing or defaulting — and emits events at each stage.

For indexer-specific event ingestion and decoding guidance, see `docs/indexer-integration.md`.

## Data Model

### `CreditLineData`

Stored in persistent storage keyed by the borrower's address.

| Field                | Type     | Description |
|----------------------|----------|-----------|
| `borrower`           | `Address` | The borrower's Stellar address |
| `credit_limit`       | `i128`   | Maximum amount the borrower can draw |
| `utilized_amount`    | `i128`   | Amount currently drawn |
| `interest_rate_bps`  | `u32`    | Annual interest rate in basis points (e.g. 300 = 3%) |
| `risk_score`         | `u32`    | Risk score assigned by the risk engine (0–100) |
| `status`             | `CreditStatus` | Current status of the credit line |
| `last_rate_update_ts`| `u64`    | Ledger timestamp of the last interest-rate change (0 = never updated) |
| `accrued_interest`   | `i128`   | Cumulative capitalized interest recorded on the line |
| `last_accrual_ts`    | `u64`    | Ledger timestamp of the last interest accrual checkpoint (0 = never accrued) |

### `RateChangeConfig`
Stored in instance storage under the `"rate_cfg"` key. Optional — when absent, no rate-change limits are enforced.

| Field                     | Type  | Description |
|---------------------------|-------|-----------|
| `max_rate_change_bps`     | `u32` | Maximum absolute change in `interest_rate_bps` allowed per update |
| `rate_change_min_interval`| `u64` | Minimum elapsed seconds between consecutive rate changes |

### `CreditStatus`

| Variant    | Value | Description |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| `Active`   | 0     | Credit line is open and available |
| `Suspended`| 1     | Credit line is temporarily suspended |
| `Defaulted`| 2     | Borrower has defaulted; draw disabled, repay allowed |
| `Closed`   | 3     | Credit line has been permanently closed |
| `Restricted` | 4   | Limit is below utilization; additional draws are blocked until cured |

### Status transitions

| From       | To         | Trigger |
|------------|------------|---------|
| Active     | Suspended  | Admin calls `suspend_credit_line` |
| Active     | Defaulted  | Admin calls `default_credit_line` |
| Suspended  | Defaulted  | Admin calls `default_credit_line` |
| Defaulted  | Active     | Admin calls `reinstate_credit_line` |
| Defaulted  | Closed     | Admin or borrower (when `utilized_amount == 0`) calls `close_credit_line` |
| Active     | Closed     | Admin or borrower (when `utilized_amount == 0`) calls `close_credit_line` |
| Suspended  | Closed     | Admin or borrower (when `utilized_amount == 0`) calls `close_credit_line` |

When status is **Defaulted**: `draw_credit` is disabled; `repay_credit` is still allowed.

## Methods

### `init(env, admin)`
Initializes the contract with an admin address. Must be called exactly once.

- Stores `admin` in instance storage under the `"admin"` key.
- Sets `LiquiditySource` to the contract's own address as a deterministic default.
- Reverts with `ContractError::AlreadyInitialized` (14) if called a second time, preventing admin takeover via re-initialization.

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `admin` | `Address` | Address that will hold admin authority over this contract |

#### Errors
| Condition | Error |
|---|---|
| Contract already initialized | `ContractError::AlreadyInitialized` (14) |

#### Security notes
- Must be called by the deployer immediately after deployment.
- The guard checks for the presence of the `"admin"` key before writing; no storage is mutated on a rejected second call.
- Admin rotation is two-step (`propose_admin` then `accept_admin`) with an optional delay.
- `LiquiditySource` defaults to the contract address and can be updated post-init via `set_liquidity_source` (admin only).

### `propose_admin(env, new_admin, delay_seconds)`
Creates or overwrites a pending admin proposal (admin only).

- Stores `new_admin` under `"proposed_admin"` and acceptance timestamp under `"proposed_at"`.
- `delay_seconds = 0` allows immediate acceptance.
- A second proposal **overwrites** the previous pending proposal and its delay window.
- Emits `("credit", "admin_prop")` with `AdminRotationProposedEvent`.

### `accept_admin(env)`
Accepts a pending admin proposal (proposed admin only).

- Caller must be exactly the currently proposed admin.
- Reverts with `ContractError::AdminAcceptTooEarly` (15) if called before `"proposed_at"`.
- On success, updates `"admin"` and clears `"proposed_admin"`/`"proposed_at"`.
- Emits `("credit", "admin_acc")` with `AdminRotationAcceptedEvent`.

### `set_liquidity_token(env, token_address)`
Sets the Stellar Asset Contract token used for draws and repayments (admin only).

- Writes the token contract address to instance storage under `DataKey::LiquidityToken`.
- Only the configured admin may update this value; unauthorized callers fail auth before storage is mutated.
- Covered by unit tests in `contracts/credit/src/lib.rs` for both successful admin updates and rejected non-admin calls.

### `set_liquidity_source(env, reserve_address)`
Sets the address that holds liquidity for draws and receives repayments (defaults to contract address).

### `open_credit_line(env, borrower, credit_limit, interest_rate_bps, risk_score)`
Opens a new credit line for a borrower. Called by the backend or risk engine.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `borrower` | `Address` | Borrower's address |
| `credit_limit` | `i128` | Maximum drawable amount (must be > 0) |
| `interest_rate_bps` | `u32` | Annual interest rate in basis points (0–10000) |
| `risk_score` | `u32` | Risk score from the risk engine (0–100) |

`last_rate_update_ts`, `accrued_interest`, and `last_accrual_ts` are initialized to `0`.

#### Errors
| Condition | Error |
|---|---|
| `credit_limit <= 0` | `ContractError::InvalidAmount` |
| `interest_rate_bps > 10000` | `ContractError::RateTooHigh` |
| `risk_score > 100` | `ContractError::ScoreTooHigh` |
| Borrower already has an Active line | `ContractError::Unauthorized` |

Emits: `("credit", "opened")` event with a `CreditLineEvent` payload.

### `draw_credit(env, borrower, amount)`
Draw funds from an **Active** credit line. Caller must be the borrower.

- Reverts if line is Closed, Suspended, Defaulted, or does not exist.
- Reverts if draw would exceed `credit_limit`.
- Transfers tokens from liquidity source → borrower.

Emits: `("credit", "drawn")` event.

### `repay_credit(env, borrower, amount)`
Repay outstanding drawn funds.

**Allowed on**: Active, Suspended, or Defaulted credit lines.  
**Not allowed on**: Closed credit lines.

**Repayment allocation policy** (applied after pending interest accrual):
1. **Accrue pending interest** — `apply_pending_accrual` capitalizes any elapsed interest into `utilized_amount` and `accrued_interest` before repayment is applied. This prevents interest evasion through frequent repayments.
2. **Cap overpayment** — `effective_repay = min(amount, utilized_amount)`. Overpayments beyond total owed are ignored (no refund).
3. **Interest first** — `interest_repaid = min(effective_repay, accrued_interest)`.
4. **Principal second** — `principal_repaid = effective_repay - interest_repaid`.
5. **Update state** — `accrued_interest` and `utilized_amount` are reduced accordingly.

- The borrower must have approved the contract to pull tokens via `transfer_from`.
- Tokens are transferred **before** state is updated. If the transfer fails, the call reverts with no state change.
- Repayment failures due to insufficient allowance or balance do not alter `utilized_amount`, `accrued_interest`, or the credit line record.
- Works even when no liquidity token is configured (state-only update).

Emits: `("credit", "repay")` event with `RepaymentEvent` payload containing:
- `amount` — effective amount repaid (capped at total owed)
- `interest_repaid` — portion applied to accrued interest
- `principal_repaid` — portion applied to principal
- `new_utilized_amount` — total outstanding debt after repayment
- `new_accrued_interest` — remaining interest debt after repayment

Integrators can reconcile balances using:
- `principal_owed = new_utilized_amount - new_accrued_interest`
- `total_owed = new_utilized_amount`

### `update_risk_parameters(env, borrower, credit_limit, interest_rate_bps, risk_score)`
Update credit limit, interest rate, and risk score (admin only).

When `RateChangeConfig` is set, rate changes are subject to:
- Maximum delta ≤ `max_rate_change_bps`
- Minimum time interval ≥ `rate_change_min_interval`

Emits: `("credit", "risk_updated")` event.

### `set_rate_change_limits(env, max_rate_change_bps, rate_change_min_interval)`
Configure rate-change limits (admin only).

### `get_rate_change_limits(env) -> Option<RateChangeConfig>`
Returns the current rate-change configuration (or `None` if not set).
### `update_risk_parameters(env, borrower, credit_limit, interest_rate_bps, risk_score)`

Update the risk parameters for an existing credit line. Admin-only.

| Parameter           | Type      | Description                                            |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `borrower`          | `Address` | Borrower whose credit line to update                   |
| `credit_limit`      | `i128`    | New credit limit (must be ≥ current `utilized_amount`) |
| `interest_rate_bps` | `u32`     | New interest rate in basis points (0–10000)            |
| `risk_score`        | `u32`     | New risk score (0–100)                                 |

#### Credit Limit Decrease Behavior

When `credit_limit` is decreased below the current `utilized_amount`:

- The credit line status changes to **Restricted**
- `utilized_amount` remains unchanged (borrower must repay excess)
- `draw_credit` is disabled until excess is repaid or limit is increased
- A `("credit", "limit_dec")` event is emitted with details

When `credit_limit` is decreased but remains ≥ `utilized_amount`:

- The credit line remains **Active**
- Normal operation continues

When `credit_limit` is increased or unchanged:

- Normal behavior applies
- If currently Restricted, increasing limit above `utilized_amount` reactivates to **Active**

#### Rate-change limits (optional, backward-compatible)

When a `RateChangeConfig` has been set via `set_rate_change_limits`, the following
checks are enforced **only when the interest rate is actually changing**:

- The absolute delta `|new_rate - old_rate|` must be ≤ `max_rate_change_bps`.
- If `last_rate_update_ts > 0` and `rate_change_min_interval > 0`, the elapsed
  time since the last rate change must be ≥ `rate_change_min_interval`.
- If the rate is **unchanged**, both checks are skipped entirely.
- If **no config is set**, no limits are enforced (fully backward-compatible).

On a successful rate change, `last_rate_update_ts` is updated to the current
ledger timestamp.

#### Errors

| Condition                        | Panic message                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Caller is not admin              | Auth error                                             |
| Credit line not found            | `ContractError::CreditLineNotFound`                    |
| `credit_limit < utilized_amount` | `ContractError::OverLimit`                             |
| `credit_limit < 0`               | `ContractError::NegativeLimit`                         |
| `interest_rate_bps > 10000`      | `ContractError::RateTooHigh`                           |
| `risk_score > 100`               | `ContractError::ScoreTooHigh`                          |
| Rate delta exceeds max           | `"rate change exceeds maximum allowed delta"`          |
| Too soon since last change       | `"rate change too soon: minimum interval not elapsed"` |

Emits: `RiskParametersUpdatedEvent` with borrower, new credit limit, new rate, new score.

#### Security notes

- Rate-change config is optional and stored in instance storage.
- Absence of config means **no limits** — fully backward-compatible.
- `last_rate_update_ts = 0` (never updated) always bypasses the interval check,
  so the first rate change is never blocked by the time window.
- The delta check uses `abs_diff` which is symmetric and overflow-safe.

#### Ledger timestamp trust assumptions
- The cooldown window relies on `env.ledger().timestamp()` from the Soroban host.
- Production deployments therefore trust the network-provided ledger timestamp to be monotonic enough for coarse cooldown enforcement.
- This mechanism is suitable for protocol-level spacing of administrative rate changes, not for sub-second precision or wall-clock guarantees.
- Test coverage should explicitly exercise:
  - first update with `last_rate_update_ts == 0`
  - exactly-at-boundary acceptance
  - just-before-boundary rejection
  - `rate_change_min_interval == 0` disabling the timing gate entirely

### `suspend_credit_line(env, borrower)`
Suspend an Active credit line (admin only).

- Reverts if the line does not exist.
- Reverts unless the current status is `Active`.

Emits: `("credit", "suspend")` event.

### Interest accrual

Interest accrual fields exist in storage, but scheduled/lazy accrual logic is not yet active in the contract.

The intended implementation design is documented separately in [`docs/interest-accrual.md`](interest-accrual.md).

### `close_credit_line(env, borrower, closer)`
Close a credit line.

- Admin can close any time.
- Borrower can close only when `utilized_amount == 0`.

Emits: `("credit", "closed")` event.

### `default_credit_line(env, borrower)`
Mark credit line as Defaulted (admin only).

Emits: `("credit", "default")` event.

### `reinstate_credit_line(env, borrower, target_status)`
Reinstate a Defaulted credit line to `target_status` (Active or Suspended). Admin only.

Emits: `("credit", "reinstate")` event.

### `get_credit_line(env, borrower) -> Option<CreditLineData>`
View function — returns credit line data or `None`.

### `freeze_draws(env)`
Freeze all `draw_credit` calls contract-wide (admin only).

- Sets `DataKey::DrawsFrozen` to `true` in instance storage.
- Does **not** mutate any borrower's `CreditStatus`; lines remain Active, Defaulted, etc.
- Repayments are never blocked by this flag.
- Idempotent: calling when already frozen still emits the event.

Emits: `("credit", "drw_freeze")` with `DrawsFrozenEvent { frozen: true, timestamp, actor }`.

### `unfreeze_draws(env)`
Re-enable `draw_credit` after a global freeze (admin only).

- Sets `DataKey::DrawsFrozen` to `false` in instance storage.
- Idempotent: calling when already unfrozen still emits the event.

Emits: `("credit", "drw_freeze")` with `DrawsFrozenEvent { frozen: false, timestamp, actor }`.

### `is_draws_frozen(env) -> bool`
Returns `true` when draws are globally frozen. Defaults to `false` when the key has never been set. No auth required.

## Overflow Policy

Arithmetic paths that affect credit limit and utilization stay in integer-only arithmetic.

- `draw_credit`: utilization update uses `checked_add`; arithmetic overflow reverts with `ContractError::Overflow` (`12`).
- `repay_credit`: inputs must be positive integers; the contract computes `effective_repay = min(amount, utilized_amount)` and then applies the allocation policy (interest first, then principal) using `saturating_sub` and `max(0)` to keep both `accrued_interest` and `utilized_amount` non-negative. Over-repayments are capped at total owed.
- `apply_pending_accrual`: interest calculation uses checked multiplication and division; overflow reverts with `ContractError::Overflow` (`12`).
- `update_risk_parameters`: limit/risk bounds are validated before state updates; rate delta uses `abs_diff` for overflow-safe unsigned distance checks.

### Integer arithmetic assumptions

- Amounts and limits are stored as whole-number `i128` values; there is no fractional accounting or rounding path inside the contract.
- `open_credit_line` requires a positive limit, and `draw_credit` / `repay_credit` both reject non-positive amounts at the contract boundary.
- Because `repay_credit` caps the applied amount to current utilization before subtraction, repayment paths preserve the invariant `0 <= utilized_amount`.
- While a line is `Active`, draw paths also preserve `utilized_amount <= credit_limit`; dedicated invariant tests cover repeated draw and repay sequences across status changes.

### Large-number test coverage

The contract test suite includes explicit large-value coverage:

- `test_draw_credit_near_i128_max_succeeds_without_overflow`
- `test_draw_credit_overflow_reverts_with_defined_error`
- `test_draw_credit_large_values_exceed_limit_reverts_with_defined_error`
- `test_repay_credit_large_amount_caps_at_zero_without_underflow`
- `utilization_stays_bounded_across_active_scenarios`
- `utilization_never_goes_negative_after_repays_across_statuses`
- `test_update_risk_parameters_rejects_limit_below_utilized_near_i128_max`

These tests validate behavior near `i128::MAX` and confirm overflow handling remains deterministic.

## Error Codes

The `Credit` contract uses standard `u32` discriminants for standardized error handling across the Rust and TypeScript SDK clients. Integrator clients can match these error codes to understand failure reasons.

| Error Code | Variant              | Description                                                                 |

| `3`        | `CreditLineNotFound` | The specified credit line was not found.                                    |
| `4`        | `CreditLineClosed`   | Action cannot be performed because the credit line is closed.               |
| `5`        | `InvalidAmount`      | The requested amount is invalid (e.g., zero or negative).                   |
| `6`        | `OverLimit`          | The requested draw exceeds the available credit limit.                      |
| `7`        | `NegativeLimit`      | The credit limit cannot be negative.                                        |

| `11`       | `Reentrancy`         | Reentrancy detected during cross-contract calls.                            |
| `12`       | `Overflow`           | Math overflow occurred during calculation.                                  |
| `13`       | `LimitDecreaseRequiresRepayment` | Credit limit decrease requires immediate repayment of excess amount. |
| `14`       | `AlreadyInitialized` | Contract has already been initialized; `init` may only be called once.      |
| `15`       | `DrawsFrozen` | All draws are globally frozen by admin for liquidity reserve operations.    |

The contract also emits additive v2 event topics (for indexer analytics fields
like actor/source/timestamp identifiers) while keeping v1 payloads stable. See
[`docs/indexer-integration.md`](indexer-integration.md) for full topic mapping.

> Note: `open_credit_line` requires admin authorization (`require_auth`). The admin key is the backend/risk engine signer — borrowers cannot open their own credit lines.

### Related Admin Workflows

## Admin Rotation Proposal

### Current risk

The current contract stores a single immutable admin address in instance storage. That keeps the access model simple, but it creates a high-impact operational risk:

- a deployment initialized with the wrong admin address is effectively unrecoverable
- an admin key compromise cannot be remediated on-chain
- key-rotation policies require redeployment instead of controlled handoff

### Recommended design

Use a **two-step admin rotation** instead of a one-call `transfer_admin`.

#### Proposed API

```rust
/// Propose a new admin. Callable only by the current admin.
pub fn propose_admin(env: Env, new_admin: Address);

/// Accept a pending admin role. Callable only by the pending admin.
pub fn accept_admin(env: Env);

/// Cancel a pending admin handoff. Callable only by the current admin.
pub fn cancel_admin_rotation(env: Env);

/// View the current pending admin, if any.
pub fn get_pending_admin(env: Env) -> Option<Address>;
```

#### Why two-step is preferred

A direct `transfer_admin(new_admin)` permanently changes authority in one call. That is efficient, but it increases wrong-address risk because:

- the current admin may submit the wrong destination address
- the destination may be a contract or wallet that cannot complete intended operations
- the protocol loses the ability to prove that the receiving operator actually controls the destination key

The two-step model lowers that risk because the recipient must explicitly accept the role.

### Storage additions

If implemented, add a new instance-storage slot:

| Key | Storage Type | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `"pending_admin"` | Instance | `Address` |

The `"admin"` slot remains authoritative until `accept_admin` succeeds.

### Threat model update

#### Assets protected

- admin authority over credit-line lifecycle operations
- admin authority over liquidity source/token configuration
- admin authority over risk-parameter changes

#### Trust boundaries

- the current `admin` is trusted to nominate a valid successor
- the `pending_admin` is trusted only after they successfully authenticate and accept
- observers and indexers may treat rotation events as security-relevant governance actions

#### Failure modes and mitigations

| Failure mode | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Wrong address proposed | Permanent governance loss with one-step transfer | Two-step acceptance keeps current admin active until recipient confirms |
| Proposed admin never responds | Rotation stuck in pending state | `cancel_admin_rotation` allows admin to abort and retry |
| Current admin key compromise | Attacker can still propose a malicious admin | Not fully solvable on-chain; mitigated operationally by hardware wallets, monitoring, and fast cancellation if compromise is detected before acceptance |
| Malicious pending admin | Attempts to seize control without nomination | `accept_admin` must require `pending_admin.require_auth()` and exact match against stored pending admin |
| Event/indexing ambiguity | Off-chain systems misread control state | Emit explicit proposal / cancellation / acceptance events and document that only accepted admin is authoritative |

### Operational procedure

Recommended production workflow:

1. Current admin verifies the target address out of band.
2. Current admin calls `propose_admin(new_admin)`.
3. Off-chain monitoring confirms the pending-admin event and storage value.
4. Proposed admin verifies the contract ID and calls `accept_admin()`.
5. Monitoring confirms the old admin was replaced and `pending_admin` was cleared.
6. If the proposal was wrong or stale, current admin calls `cancel_admin_rotation()` before acceptance.

### Testing requirements for implementation

If/when implemented, the minimum invariant coverage should include:

- only current admin can call `propose_admin`
- only current admin can call `cancel_admin_rotation`
- only the exact pending admin can call `accept_admin`
- `admin` remains unchanged until acceptance
- `pending_admin` is cleared after acceptance or cancellation
- proposing the current admin should be rejected to avoid no-op ambiguity
- a missing pending admin should cause `accept_admin` to fail deterministically

### Implementation note

Given the sensitivity of governance handoff, a one-step `transfer_admin` should only be added if maintainers explicitly prefer operational simplicity over wrong-address protection. The safer default for this contract is the two-step rotation flow above.

## Interest Model

All sensitive functions enforce authorization via `require_auth()`.

## Deployment Playbook

This section covers deploying the credit contract to Stellar testnet and invoking its core methods. All examples use the [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/cli/stellar-cli) (`stellar`).

### Prerequisites

- Rust with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- Stellar CLI installed: `cargo install --locked stellar-cli --features opt`
- A funded testnet identity (never commit private keys)

### 1. Identity setup

```bash
# Generate a new keypair and store it locally under an alias
stellar keys generate --global admin --network testnet

# Fund it via Friendbot
stellar keys fund admin --network testnet

# Confirm the address
stellar keys address admin
```

For the backend/risk-engine identity used to open credit lines:

This section provides step-by-step instructions to deploy the contract on Stellar testnet,
initialize it, configure liquidity, and invoke core methods.

### Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.75+** with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target installed
- **Stellar Soroban CLI** v21.0.0+: [install guide](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools-and-sdks/cli/install-soroban-cli)
- **soroban-cli configured network**: add testnet or futurenet if not present
- **Account on testnet**: funded with XLM for gas and operations

### Step 1: Network and Identity Setup

#### Configure Stellar Testnet

```bash
soroban network add --name testnet --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org:443 --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"
```

#### Create or Import an Identity

```bash
# Generate a new identity (stores keypair in ~/.config/soroban/keys/)
soroban keys generate admin --network testnet

# Or import an existing keypair
soroban keys generate admin --secret-key --network testnet
# Then paste your secret key (starts with S...)
```

Verify the identity was created:

```bash
soroban keys ls
```

Fund the identity's address on testnet:
1. Get the public key: `soroban keys show admin`
2. Visit [Stellar Testnet Friendbot](https://friendbot.stellar.org/) and fund the address
3. Wait for the transaction to confirm (~5 seconds)

### Step 2: Build the Contract

```bash
# Build release WASM (optimized for size and deployment)
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -p creditra-credit
```

The compiled WASM is at: `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/creditra_credit.wasm`

### Step 3: Deploy the Contract

```bash
# Deploy to testnet
CONTRACT_ID=$(soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/creditra_credit.wasm \
  --source admin \
  --network testnet)

echo "Contract deployed at: $CONTRACT_ID"
```

Save the `CONTRACT_ID` in an environment variable for subsequent commands.

### Step 4: Initialize the Contract

```bash
# Get the admin identity's public key
ADMIN_PUBKEY=$(soroban keys show admin)

# Initialize with admin
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source admin \
  --network testnet \
  -- init --admin $ADMIN_PUBKEY
```

This sets the admin address and defaults the liquidity source to the contract address.

### Step 5: Configure Liquidity Token and Source

#### (Optional) Create a Test Liquidity Token

If deploying a mock token for testing:

```bash
# Deploy a Stellar Asset Contract for USDC (testnet)
USDC_CONTRACT=$(soroban contract deploy native \
  --network testnet \
  --source admin)

echo "USDC contract at: $USDC_CONTRACT"
```

#### Set Liquidity Token

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source admin \
  --network testnet \
  -- set_liquidity_token --token_address $USDC_CONTRACT
```

#### Set Liquidity Source (Reserve Account)

The liquidity source is where reserve tokens are held. It can be the contract address,
an external reserve account, or another contract.

```bash
# Option A: Keep contract as reserve (already set in init)
# No additional action needed

# Option B: Set a different reserve account
RESERVE_PUBKEY=$(soroban keys show reserve)
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source admin \
  --network testnet \
  -- set_liquidity_source --reserve_address $RESERVE_PUBKEY
```

### Step 6: Open a Credit Line

Create a credit line for a borrower. This is typically called by the backend/risk engine.

```bash
# Generate or use an existing borrower identity
soroban keys generate borrower --network testnet
BORROWER_PUBKEY=$(soroban keys show borrower)

# Open a credit line
# - borrower: the borrower address
# - credit_limit: 10000 (in smallest token unit, typically microunits)
# - interest_rate_bps: 300 (3% annual interest)
# - risk_score: 75 (out of 100)
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source admin \
  --network testnet \
  -- open_credit_line \
    --borrower $BORROWER_PUBKEY \
    --credit_limit 10000 \
    --interest_rate_bps 300 \
    --risk_score 75
```

Verify the credit line was created:

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source admin \
  --network testnet \
  -- get_credit_line --borrower $BORROWER_PUBKEY
```

### Step 7: Fund the Liquidity Reserve

If using a liquidity token, the reserve account must hold sufficient balance for draws.

```bash
# If USDC contract is the token, fund the reserve
# This example assumes the contract is the reserve
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $USDC_CONTRACT \
  --source admin \
  --network testnet \
  -- mint --to $CONTRACT_ID --amount 50000

# Verify reserve balance
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $USDC_CONTRACT \
  --source admin \
  --network testnet \
  -- balance --id $CONTRACT_ID
```

### Step 8: Draw Credit

A borrower draws against their credit line. This transfers tokens from the reserve to the borrower.

```bash
# Borrower draws 1000 units
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source borrower \
  --network testnet \
  -- draw_credit \
    --borrower $BORROWER_PUBKEY \
    --amount 1000
```

Verify the draw:

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source admin \
  --network testnet \
  -- get_credit_line --borrower $BORROWER_PUBKEY
```

Expected result: `utilized_amount` should now be 1000.

### Step 9: Repay Credit

Borrowers repay their drawn amount. The tokens are transferred back to the liquidity source.

#### Prerequisite: Approve Token Transfer

The borrower must approve the contract to transfer tokens on their behalf.

```bash
# Borrower approves the contract to transfer up to 2000 units
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $USDC_CONTRACT \
  --source borrower \
  --network testnet \
  -- approve \
    --from $BORROWER_PUBKEY \
    --spender $CONTRACT_ID \
    --amount 2000 \
    --expiration_ledger 1000000
```

#### Execute Repayment

```bash
# Borrower repays 500 units
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source borrower \
  --network testnet \
  -- repay_credit \
    --borrower $BORROWER_PUBKEY \
    --amount 500
```

Verify the repayment:

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source admin \
  --network testnet \
  -- get_credit_line --borrower $BORROWER_PUBKEY
```

Expected result: `utilized_amount` should now be 500.

### Step 10: Update Risk Parameters (Admin Only)

The admin can adjust credit limits, interest rates, and risk scores.

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source admin \
  --network testnet \
  -- update_risk_parameters \
    --borrower $BORROWER_PUBKEY \
    --credit_limit 20000 \
    --interest_rate_bps 400 \
    --risk_score 85
```

### Step 11: Manage Credit Line Status

#### Suspend a Credit Line

Prevent draws while allowing repayment.

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source admin \
  --network testnet \
  -- suspend_credit_line --borrower $BORROWER_PUBKEY
```

#### Default a Credit Line

Mark the borrower as in default (blocks draws, allows repayment).

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source admin \
  --network testnet \
  -- default_credit_line --borrower $BORROWER_PUBKEY
```

#### Close a Credit Line

- **Admin**: can force-close at any time
- **Borrower**: can only close when `utilized_amount` is 0

```bash
# Admin force-close
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source admin \
  --network testnet \
  -- close_credit_line \
    --borrower $BORROWER_PUBKEY \
    --closer $ADMIN_PUBKEY

# Or borrower self-close (only when fully repaid)
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source borrower \
  --network testnet \
  -- close_credit_line \
    --borrower $BORROWER_PUBKEY \
    --closer $BORROWER_PUBKEY
```

### Useful Quick Reference

**Export identities to variables for scripting:**

```bash
ADMIN=$(soroban keys show admin)
BORROWER=$(soroban keys show borrower)
RESERVE=$(soroban keys show reserve)
TOKEN=$USDC_CONTRACT
CONTRACT=$CONTRACT_ID
```

**Query contract state:**

```bash
# Check a specific credit line
soroban contract invoke --id $CONTRACT --source admin --network testnet -- get_credit_line --borrower $BORROWER

# Check token balance
soroban contract invoke --id $TOKEN --source admin --network testnet -- balance --id $CONTRACT
```

**Troubleshooting common errors:**

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `HostError: Error(Auth, InvalidAction)` | Identity not authorized | Ensure `--source` identity is loaded and has been funded |
| `HostError: Value(ContractError(1))` | Credit line not found | Verify credit line was opened with correct borrower address |
| `HostError: Error(Contract, InvalidContractData)` | Contract ID invalid or contract not deployed | Check `$CONTRACT_ID` and verify deployment succeeded |
| `Insufficient liquidity reserve` | Reserve balance too low | Fund the reserve with more tokens via `mint` or transfer |
| `Insufficient allowance` | Token approval too low | Increase borrower's approval via token `approve` |

## Appendix: Storage Key Audit

### Instance Storage

Keys that share the contract instance TTL. If the instance is archived, all
these keys are lost. Production deployments should call
`env.storage().instance().extend_ttl()` periodically.

| Key | Rust type | Value type | Written by | Notes |
|-----|-----------|------------|------------|-------|
| `Symbol("admin")` | `Symbol` | `Address` | `init` | Contract admin. Written exactly once; second write reverts with `AlreadyInitialized`. |
| `DataKey::LiquidityToken` | `DataKey` | `Address` | `set_liquidity_token` | Token contract for reserve/draw transfers. |
| `DataKey::LiquiditySource` | `DataKey` | `Address` | `init`, `set_liquidity_source` | Reserve address. Defaults to contract address. |
| `Symbol("reentrancy")` | `Symbol` | `bool` | `set_reentrancy_guard`, `clear_reentrancy_guard` | Defense-in-depth flag. Cleared on every code path. |
| `Symbol("rate_cfg")` | `Symbol` | `RateChangeConfig` | `set_rate_change_limits` | Admin-configurable rate-change governance. |
| `DataKey::DrawsFrozen` | `DataKey` | `bool` | `freeze_draws`, `unfreeze_draws` | Global emergency draw freeze. Absent = `false` (draws allowed). |

**Why instance?** These are global singleton configuration values. There is
exactly one admin, one liquidity token, one liquidity source, and one rate
config per contract deployment. Instance storage is correct.

### Persistent Storage

Per-borrower records with independent TTL per entry.

| Key | Rust type | Value type | Written by | Notes |
|-----|-----------|------------|------------|-------|
| Borrower `Address` | `Address` | `CreditLineData` | `open_credit_line`, `draw_credit`, `repay_credit`, `update_risk_parameters`, status transitions | Long-lived borrower data. Independent TTL. |

**Why persistent?** Each borrower's credit line must survive beyond a single
transaction and has an independent lifecycle. Persistent is correct. If a
borrower's entry TTL expires (archival), their credit line data is lost —
production deployments should bump TTL on access or via a keeper.

### Temporary Storage

Not currently used. Future candidate: the reentrancy guard could move to
temporary storage since it only needs to survive within a single invocation.
Instance storage works correctly today because it is always cleared.

### Audit Findings

1. **Admin** — correctly on instance. Single value, global.
2. **LiquidityToken / LiquiditySource** — correctly on instance. Global config.
3. **Reentrancy flag** — correctly on instance (cleared every call). Could
   optionally move to temporary storage for cleaner semantics.
4. **Rate config** — correctly on instance. Global governance parameter.
5. **Borrower records** — correctly on persistent. Per-entity, long-lived.
6. **No borrower data on instance** — verified. No volatile/instance keys are
   used for per-borrower data.
7. **TTL management** — not yet implemented. Recommend adding
   `extend_ttl()` calls on instance (in `init` or a dedicated `bump` endpoint)
   and on persistent (on credit line access) before production deployment.
8. **DrawsFrozen** — correctly on instance. Global singleton flag; absent key
   is treated as `false` (draws allowed). Shares instance TTL — extend alongside
   other instance keys.

You can also run all workspace tests from the repository root with `cargo test`.

## Error Reference

This section documents all contract errors and their exact error codes for consistent error handling across integrations.

### ContractError Enum

| Error Code | Variant | Description | Trigger |
|------------|---------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | `Unauthorized` | Caller is not authorized to perform this action | Various admin-only operations |
| 2 | `NotAdmin` | Caller does not have admin privileges | `require_admin_auth` checks |
| 3 | `CreditLineNotFound` | The specified credit line was not found | Operations on non-existent credit lines |
| 4 | `CreditLineClosed` | Action cannot be performed because the credit line is closed | Draw operations on closed lines |
| 5 | `InvalidAmount` | The requested amount is invalid (e.g., zero or negative) | Amount validation in draw/repay |
| 6 | `OverLimit` | The requested draw exceeds the available credit limit | Draw limit checks |
| 7 | `NegativeLimit` | The credit limit cannot be negative | Credit limit validation |
| 8 | `RateTooHigh` | The interest rate exceeds maximum allowed (10000 bps = 100%) | Rate bounds validation |
| 9 | `ScoreTooHigh` | The risk score exceeds maximum allowed (100) | Score bounds validation |
| 10 | `UtilizationNotZero` | Action cannot be performed because the credit line utilization is not zero | Certain admin operations |
| 11 | `Reentrancy` | Reentrancy detected during cross-contract calls | Reentrancy guard |
| 12 | `Overflow` | Math overflow occurred during calculation | Arithmetic operations |
| 13 | `LimitDecreaseRequiresRepayment` | Credit limit decrease requires immediate repayment of excess amount | Limit decrease validation |
| 14 | `AlreadyInitialized` | Contract has already been initialized; `init` may only be called once | Second `init` call |
| 15 | `DrawsFrozen` | All draws are globally frozen by admin for liquidity reserve operations | `draw_credit` when `DataKey::DrawsFrozen` is `true` |
| 16 | `DrawExceedsMaxAmount` | The requested draw exceeds the configured per-transaction maximum | `draw_credit` when `DataKey::MaxDrawAmount` is set |

### Rate and Score Validation

**Interest Rate Bounds:**
- Valid range: `0` to `10_000` basis points (0% to 100%)
- Error on violation: `ContractError::RateTooHigh` (code 8)
- Applied in: `open_credit_line`, `update_risk_parameters`

**Risk Score Bounds:**
- Valid range: `0` to `100`
- Error on violation: `ContractError::ScoreTooHigh` (code 9)  
- Applied in: `open_credit_line`, `update_risk_parameters`

### Boundary Test Coverage

The contract includes comprehensive table-driven tests that verify:

1. **Exact boundary acceptance**: Values at the exact limits (0, 10000 bps, 100 score) are accepted
2. **One-past boundary rejection**: Values one unit beyond limits (10001 bps, 101 score) are rejected
3. **Error mapping consistency**: Both `open_credit_line` and `update_risk_parameters` use the same error types
4. **Edge case validation**: Granular testing around boundary values (9999, 10000, 10001)

For detailed test implementation, see `boundary_tests.rs` in the source code.

### Error Handling Best Practices

1. **Always check error codes**: Use the numeric error codes for reliable error handling
2. **Handle RateTooHigh/ScoreTooHigh specifically**: These errors indicate input validation failures
3. **Distinguish between error types**: `RateTooHigh` (8) vs `ScoreTooHigh` (9) for precise validation feedback
4. **Test boundary conditions**: Include tests for exact bounds and one-past bounds in all integrations

## Borrower Blocklist

The borrower blocklist provides an emergency gating mechanism that allows the protocol admin to temporarily prevent specific borrowers from drawing credit without modifying their underlying `CreditStatus` or credit line data. This is useful during investigations, compliance reviews, or when suspicious activity is detected.

### Methods

#### `set_borrower_blocked(env, borrower, blocked)`
- **Access**: Admin only
- **Parameters**:
  - `borrower`: Address to block or unblock
  - `blocked`: `true` to block, `false` to unblock
- **Behavior**: Stores the blocked flag in persistent storage keyed by borrower. Emits a `BorrowerBlockedEvent` with topic `("credit", "blocked")` or `("credit", "unblocked")`.
- **Security**: Requires admin auth. Does not mutate `CreditLineData` or `CreditStatus`.

#### `is_borrower_blocked(env, borrower) -> bool`
- **Access**: View function (no auth required)
- **Returns**: `true` if the borrower is currently blocked, `false` otherwise (including if no record exists).

### Enforcement

The blocklist is enforced exclusively in `draw_credit`. If a blocked borrower attempts to draw:
- The transaction reverts with `ContractError::BorrowerBlocked` (code 15)
- The reentrancy guard is cleared before reverting
- Repayments via `repay_credit` remain fully operational regardless of block status

### Operational Use Cases

1. **Investigation Hold**: A borrower's account shows suspicious activity. Admin blocks draws while the investigation proceeds. The borrower's existing utilization and status remain unchanged, and they can still repay.
2. **Compliance Freeze**: Regulatory requirement to pause new draws for a specific address. Blocking avoids the need to suspend or default the line, preserving the borrower's credit history.
3. **Temporary Risk Mitigation**: Rapid response to an oracle or off-chain risk signal. The admin can block immediately and unblock once the signal resolves, without going through the `Suspended` -> `Active` state transition.

### State Machine Independence

The blocklist is intentionally decoupled from `CreditStatus`:

| Aspect | Blocklist | `CreditStatus` |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | Per-address flag | Per-credit-line enum |
| Admin action | `set_borrower_blocked` | `suspend_credit_line`, `default_credit_line`, etc. |
| Affects draws | Yes | Yes (for Suspended, Defaulted, Closed) |
| Affects repay | No | No (except Closed) |
| Event topic | `("credit", "blocked")` / `("credit", "unblocked")` | `("credit", "suspend")` / `("credit", "default")` etc. |
| Persistence | Persistent storage (`DataKey::BlockedBorrower`) | Persistent storage (`CreditLineData`) |

This separation ensures that blocking is a lightweight, reversible operational action that does not interfere with lifecycle transitions or interest accrual logic.

### Testing Requirements

- Block and unblock round-trip
- Blocked borrower cannot draw
- Unblocked borrower can draw after being unblocked
- Repayment remains allowed while blocked
- Non-admin cannot block or unblock
- Events emitted with correct topics and payloads
